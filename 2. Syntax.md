Literals 


Comments
  Used to explain the Java code.
  3 types of comments:
    1. Single-line comments:
      // A comment is written here

    2. Multi-line comments:
      /* comment starts
      continue
      explaining
      the 
      procedure
      comment ends */

    3. Documentation comments:
      /** comment starts
      * tags are used in order to specify a parameter
      * or method or heading
      * HTML tags can also be used
      * such as <h1>
      * comment ends */

Primitive Types:
    Integers:
        * Represents: byte, short, int, long
        * Whole-valued signed numbers
        * Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 == Integer.MIN_VALUE
        * Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1 == Integer.MAX_VALUE
        * byte:
            * Smallest integer type
            * Width: 8 bits
            * Limit: -128 to 127
          short:

        * Java uses Unicode to represent characters
        * No negative chars
        * ASCII range: 0 to 127

    Boolean:
        * Represents: true/ false values

Conversions:
  Type casting
    Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

  Automatic type promotion
    While resolving overloaded methods if the exact match method is not available, you will not immediately get any compile time error. First, the compiler promotes lower type argument to the higher type argument and checks whether the match method is available or not. If the match method is available, it will be considered.

    If the match method is not available, compiler promotes argument once again to the higher type. This process will be continued until all possible promotions are not checked. Still, if the match method is not available, we will get compile time error. This process is called automatic type promotion in method overloading.

  Incompatible types
    To create a conversion between the two incompatible types, you must use a cast. A cast is simply an explicit type conversion. It has general form is:

    (target-type) value
    target-type specifies the desired type to convert the specified value to.

    when a floating-point value is assigned to an integer type: truncation.

Scope and lifetime of variables 

Array:
  Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.
  Array syntax:
        dataType[] arr; (or)  
        dataType []arr; (or)  
        dataType arr[];  
        arrayRefVar=new datatype[size];

      Multi dimensional array:
        dataType[][] arrayRefVar; (or)  
        dataType [][]arrayRefVar; (or)  
        dataType arrayRefVar[][]; (or)  
        dataType []arrayRefVar[]; 
        int[][] arr=new int[3][3];

Operators

  Unary operator:
    incrementing/decrementing a value by one
    negating an expression
    inverting the value of a boolean
    Example: 
          - ++ and --
            * int x = 10;
              x++ //10 (11)
              ++x //12
            * int a = 10;
              a++ + ++a //10 + 12 = 22
          
          - ~ and !
            * int a = 10
              int b = -10
              ~a // -11
              ~b // 9
            * boolean c = true
              !c //false
  
  Arithmetic operator
    + - * / %

  Shift operator
    Left Shift Operator
      The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.
      Example: 10<<2 //10*2^2 = 10*4 = 40
    Right shift operator
      The Java right shift operator >> is used to move left operands value to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
      Example: 10>>2 //10*2^2 = 10/4 = 2

  Logical Operators
    && - doesn't check second condition if first condition is false.
    || - doesn't check second condition if first condition is true. 

  Bitwise Operators 
    & - checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
    | - checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
  
  Relational
    < > <= >= == !=
    instanceof is a binary operator used to test if an object is of a given type. The result of the operation is either true or false. It's also known as type comparison operator.

  Assignment
    =

  ? operator
    (condition)?if true:else;
  
  Precedence â˜…
    Higher precedence comes first
    Example:
      int myInt = 12 - 4 * 2; //4
      Precedence of * is higher than -.
  
  Using parenthesis
    Parentheses are used for two purposes: 
    (1) to control the order of operations in an expression, and 
    (2) to supply parameters to a constructor or method.

Enums
  The Enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of constants. 
  Example: 
    days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, and SATURDAY) , 
    directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST), 
    season (SPRING, SUMMER, WINTER, and AUTUMN or FALL), 
    colors (RED, YELLOW, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE, and BLACK) 

      values() method:
        The values() method returns an array containing all the values of the enum.
      valueOf() method:
        The valueOf() method returns the value of given constant enum.
      ordinal() method:
         The ordinal() method returns the index of the enum value.

Naming conventions
    The name must not contain any white spaces.
    The name should not start with special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).
