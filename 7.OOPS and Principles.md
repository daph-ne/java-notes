SOLID Principles :

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

Benefits of SOLID principles ;
    * Loose - Coupling
    * Code Maintainability
    * Dependancy Managemnt

Single Responsibility Principle :
    There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. This means that every class, or similar structure
in your code should have only one job to do.
    There can be a lot of members as long as they relate to the single responsibility. 
    It may be that when the one reason to change occurs, multiple members of the class may need modification. It may also
be that multiple classes will require updates.

Open Closed Principle :
    Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
    “Open to extension” means that you should design your classes so that new functionality can be added as new 
requirements are generated. 
    “Closed for modification” means that once you have developed a class you should never modify it, except to correct 
bugs.
    Applying OCP to your projects limits the need to change source code once it has been written, tested and debugged.

Liskov Substitution Principle :
    The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) applies to inheritance hierarchies, specifying that you should design your 
classes so that client dependencies can be substituted with subclasses without the client knowing about the change.

Interface Segregation Principle :


Dependency Inversion Principle :
