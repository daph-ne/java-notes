Class
    A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
    Syntax:
        class <class_name>{  
            field;  
            method;  
        }  

Objects 
    An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object
    An object has three characteristics:
        State: represents the data (value) of an object.
        Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
        Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.

Constructors
    block of codes similar to the method.
    It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
    Constructor name must be the same as its class name

Methods
    a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.
    A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task
    - Arguments, parameters
    - Return values 

this
    this is a keyword in Java which is used as a reference to the object of the current class, with in an instance method or a constructor.

Overloading
    Methods
        When a class has two or more methods by the same name but different parameters
    Constructors

Access control 
    default:
        When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. 
    private:
        the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
    protected:
        the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
    public:
        The method is accessible by all classes 

Static

Final
    If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).
    If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.
    If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.

Nested classes
    We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable.
    it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.
    Syntax:
        class Java_Outer_class{  
            //code  
            class Java_Inner_class{  
                //code  
            }  
        }  

String class, types as objects

Varargs
    If we don't know how many argument we will have to pass in the method, varargs is the better approach.
    Syntax:
        three dots after the data type.
        return_type method_name(data_type... variableName){} 
    
    While using the varargs, you must follow some rules otherwise program code won't compile. The rules are as follows:
        * There can be only one variable argument in the method.
        * Variable argument (varargs) must be the last argument.
