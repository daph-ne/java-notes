Control Statements
    The order in which the instructions in a program must be executed.

1. Conditional Statement
    * If statement
        Syntax:
            if(condition){  
                //code to be executed  
            }  
    
    * If-else Statement
        Syntax:
            if(condition){  
                //code if condition is true  
            }else{  
                //code if condition is false  
            }  

    * if-else-if ladder Statement:
        Syntax:
            if(condition1){  
                //code to be executed if condition1 is true  
            }else if(condition2){  
                //code to be executed if condition2 is true  
            }  
            else if(condition3){  
                //code to be executed if condition3 is true  
            }  
                ...                  
            else{  
                //code to be executed if all the conditions are false  
            } 

    * Nested if statement:
        Syntax:
            if(condition){    
                //code to be executed    
                if(condition){  
                    //code to be executed    
                }    
            } 

2. Iterating Statements:
    * for loops
        When to use:
            If the number of iteration is fixed.
        Syntax:
            for(init;condition;incr/decr){  
                // code to be executed 
            }
    
    * while loop
        When to use:
            If the number of iteration is not fixed.
        Syntax:
            while(condition){  
                //code to be executed 
            }

    * Do-while loop:
        When to use:
            If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once.
        Syntax:
            do{  
                //code to be executed  
            }while(condition);

3. Jump Statements:
        * break
            When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
        * continue
            In a for loop, the continue keyword causes control to immediately jump to the next statement.
            In a while loop or do/while loop, control immediately jumps to the Boolean expression.
        * return
            A return statement causes the program control to transfer back to the caller of a method.
